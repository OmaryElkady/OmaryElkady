Hi â€” Iâ€™m Omar. This is a compact home for my code, experiments, and notes focused on data engineering, ETL, and production-ready machine learning. I keep things practical and to the point â€” small utilities, short demos, and clear write-ups.

What I focus on
- Reliable ETL pipelines and data quality
- Real-time processing and orchestration
- Practical ML for production and actionable analytics
